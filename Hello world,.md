Hello world,

This is Shahryar, the developer of Tria. Passwords are so important in the new modern world, but the majority of people use a simple password or use the same password for all accounts. So I created Tria to help them.  

Tria is a  modern password generator that creates the same password by the same input data, but Tria never saves any password and just uses hash (HMAC/SHA256) to create your passwords. I tried to set all the standards for creating a strong password in Tria, such as:

- At least 8 characters
- A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters
- A mixture of letters and numbers
- Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ]

 Tria is an open-source project and you can download and use it offline . If you like Tria you can support me by sharing this page with your friends or donating! :)
