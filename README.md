Forget your old passwords and use Tria.
=======================================
the majority of people use a simple password or use the same password for all accounts. So I created Tria to help them.

Tria is a modern password generator that creates the same password by the same input data, but Tria never saves any password and just uses hash (HMAC/SHA256) to create your passwords. I tried to set all the standards for creating a strong password in Tria, such as:

    At least 8 characters
    A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters
    A mixture of letters and numbers
    Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ]

Why Tria?
---------

* Tria is full free forever.
* Easy to use.
* Nobody can hack our database.  
    Why? Because we have no database!
* Tria never saves your passwords.
* You can use strong password anywhere.
* You can even use Tria offline.
